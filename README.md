We chose to use a regressive model, which is the most typical model when predicting trends in the stock market, for example. This is because a regression model looks at the relationship between variables in order to determine which ones are relevant, or associated with the changes we are trying to predict.

Predict stock market price for TESLA. I want you to make a prediction algorithm which predicts the price of this stock on a specific date. Input will be date and output should be price of that stock (close value in the data file). You should also show the prediction percentage score. Data file: TESLA.csv For updated csv file, please download the data from: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history?p=TSLA

Pick one use case (defined below).
Explore and research which algorithm would work best for this use case (regression or classification)
Document your findings in a file (3-5 lines) on why you chose this algorithm.
Train the algorithm using Python
Keep the solution as simple as possible. We are not looking for the best machine learning algorithm. We are interested in seeing that you know how to work with machine learning.
Publish the code on GitHub and send us the link
